## Validation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Clarifications Resolved**:
1. Best shots for Days view: EXIF quality metrics (ISO, exposure, sharpness)
2. Significant events for Months view: Time-based clustering
3. Yearly highlights: Quality metrics + temporal variety

**Next Steps**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
